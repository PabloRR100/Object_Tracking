# Object Tracking

Projects based on the tutorials of [PyImageSearch](https://www.pyimagesearch.com)

### 1 - [Simple Object Tracking](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/07/23/simple-object-tracking-with-opencv/)

Object tracking is the process of:
- Taking an initial set of object detections (such as an input set of bounding box coordinates). 
- Creating a unique ID for each of the initial detections
- And then tracking each of the objects as they move around frames in a video, maintaining the assignment of unique IDs

Furthermore, object tracking allows us to apply a unique ID to each tracked object, making it possible for us to count unique objects in a video. Object tracking is paramount to building a person counter (which weâ€™ll do later in this series).

### 2 - [Real Time Object Tracking](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/07/30/opencv-object-tracking/)

Apply object detection only once and then have the object tracker be able to handle every subsequent frame, leading to a faster, more efficient object tracking pipeline.
